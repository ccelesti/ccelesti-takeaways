# Markdown File Naming Convention

To keep this repo organized, all note files should follow the format:

```
YYYY-MM_[language]_[topic-slug].md
```

### 📌 Components
- `YYYY` → year of the event or talk (e.g., 2025)
- `MM` → month of the event (e.g., 06)
- `[language]` → language of the notes (e.g., en or pt-br)
- `topic-slug` → keywords for the topic, lowercase with hyphens

### ✅ Examples:
- `2025-06_pt-br_global-opportunities.md`
- `2025-04_en_remote-work-softskills.md`
- `2025-10_pt-br_rec-n-play.md`

### ❗Notes
- Use only lowercase letters and hyphens in the slug.
- Avoid generic names like `notes.md` or `talk1.md`.
- The language should match the language you wrote the notes in (not necessarily the event language).
